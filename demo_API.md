    "text": "Good point. When you have a look at the history of chatbots ChatGPT is a bit smarter, but still too generic and has all the problems in it that the internet has (hate, bias, etc) because its database is the internet. There has to be invested a lot more time to get a tool that is really useful. If you are not firm in a certain niche it can give worth hints but if you are an expert in a niche or topic it is useless. And the problem with ‚Äûintelligence‚Äú in A.I., btw a marketing term, is that the technology behind is the simplest form of a brain simulation. It is not able to be creative and create something new to a certain problem. It is more of an intelligent pattern recognizer in a big amount of data. Helpful and faster than a human but not intelligent in the end. No system that can we trust in critical situations at the moment. The question is if we can develop an artifical intelligence without understanding how the human brain creates intelligence. Or when will we understand the human brain to start with a corresponding simulation ;-)."

    "text": "The 5k a month would be definitely be an interesting one, but I tend to watch anything you put up. I also am curious about easier ways to study or be able to tell your channels quality with a much more popular video still effecting the direct statistics for the month. See I running a Minecraft/pokemon gaming channel where I grew up watching the two and always found lots of people liked both content types, but with no channels mixing them. Changing that was my hopes and it's really run well but I have a video from about a year ago and it's blown up. It pushed to the final stretch to monetization, but it's still going sorta which yes I'm happy about, but with all the views and revenue it's getting I haven't had a month of monetization without it, so it's hard to judge my revenue, monthly views and things since it still has effects on it currently. So I don't know my channels average monthlys are. Hope that made since sorry for the ramble as well.üòÜ"

I've been working on my channel for over 12 months 650 subs, 3200 Watch Hrs. Hoping to start gaining Ad Revenue before the end of the year. But I know the real earning is outside of Ad Revenue."
